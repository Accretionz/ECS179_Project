- [Initial Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lrni1k-Eq6woD4tsD7fNe8eLkTi1OK9iI9SIc25sxOk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Core Concept
Hollow Survivor is a 2D roguelike shoot 'em up video game where the player controls an automatically attacking character while fighting continuous waves of monsters. The goal is to survive as long as possible while obtaining power ups, leveling up, and becoming stronger.
Rogue Hollow takes place in a grim fantasy world where the player, a mysterious warrior who has been exiled from their homeland, must purge their world of all evil in hopes that they may one day be able to return to the land they love or die trying. As the player slays enemies, they are granted divine blessings that unlock hidden powers, make them stronger, and improve their chances of survival. However, as the player purges the world of unclean beings, the forces of evil also begin to take notice, sending greater and more powerful enemies to stop this courageous champion.

## Core Gameplay
We start off with a title screen that allows the player to choose which mode they want to play, we would have two different modes being survival and time-based. In survival mode, the player would try to survive as long as possible as the enemies gradually get stronger. Time-based mode would have a certain time limit in which the player must survive up to given the powers they receive at the start. All modes will feature an arena like map where the monsters will spawn within as time progresses. Every minute that passes, the stronger will have increased health, damage and speed. There will also be different types of monsters that will have difficult difficulties as well as abilities. The player will need to try and survive by killing the monsters around which will drop experience upon death. The stronger the monster, the more experience that they will drop. The experience gained allows the player to level up and also increase their own stats. Leveling progression would be exponential so as the player level increases, it will be more difficult to level up.  However, every five levels that the player gains, a boss monster will spawn that the player will have to defeat to gain a new stronger weapon.  Players mode of attacking will be automatic so it does not require a keyboard input to fire. The attack pattern will depend on the weapon that is being used with some allowing for homing attacks while others are where the user is looking at.
