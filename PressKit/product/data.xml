  <description>
  Hollow Survivor is a rogue-like survivor game that takes place in a grim fantasy world where the player, a mysterious warrior who has been exiled from their homeland, must purge their world of all evil in hopes that they may one day be able to return to the land they love or die trying. As the player slays enemies, they are granted divine blessings that unlock hidden powers, make them stronger, and improve their chances of survival. However, as the player purges the world of unclean beings, the forces of evil also begin to take notice, sending greater and more powerful enemies to stop this courageous champion.
