# Game Basic Information #

## Summary ##

Rogue Hollow takes place in a grim fantasy world where the player, a mysterious warrior who has been exiled from their homeland, must purge their world of all evil in hopes that they may one day be able to return to the land they love or die trying. As the player slays enemies, they are granted divine blessings that unlock hidden powers, make them stronger, and improve their chances of survival. However, as the player purges the world of unclean beings, the forces of evil also begin to take notice, sending greater and more powerful enemies to stop this courageous champion.

**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer - Jacky Liu

- Organized a team of skilled programmers in an attempt to create a fun and playable game.
  - Roles were assigned based on preferences for the most part.
- Setting up a discord server where communication between the team can be easy and effective.
  - Having different channels that correspond to different components of the project like an assests channel.
- Setting up the github page as an effective way for the team to push and pull changes done by other team memebers.
  - Usage of branches to provide a more organized structure and allow for changes to be made without altering the master branch (but a pain to remerge)
- Usage of [whentomeet](https://www.when2meet.com/?24178901-VsgTi) to organize weekly check-in meetings with the group.
  - Some meetings were held online as it was to get the groups collective input regarding the progress and steps needed to take moving forward.
  - Held three in-person meetings where we took the current progress of all team members and tried compiling it into one game and fixing any bugs that arose.
